## Stanton Missions

??? warning "Alpha 4.0 Mission Refactor"
    In the current Alpha 4.0 Preview, the mission system is partway through a
    complete refactor and many mission types have yet to be re-implemented. Be
    aware that e.g. Delivery & Research missions will not be available until
    more of the refactor is complete.

### [Delivery Missions](./missions/delivery.md)

Delivery missions are a simple introduction to missions & contracts in Star
Citizen; they don't pay a lot of money, but they're low risk, and are a great
way to explore different locations around the 'verse.

### [Research Missions](./missions/research.md)

Research missions are a variant on delivery missions, and involve collecting
survey & scanning equipment and delivering it to orbital locations around the
'verse.

### [Cargo Hauling](./missions/hauling.md)

Cargo Hauling is a lower-risk cargo mission that involves transporting goods for
NPC factions. 

## Combat

### [NPC Ship Bounties](./missions/ship-bounties.md)

NPC Ship Bounties involve hunting down and destroying or capturing NPC-piloted
ships. These missions can be dangerous but offer significant rewards for
successful completion.

### [Bunker Missions & NPC Ground Bounties](./missions/fps-combat.md)

Bunker Missions & NPC Ground Bounties require players to engage in first-person
combat against NPC enemies in various locations.

<!-- ### [Boarding Actions](./missions/fps-combat.md)

### [Hunting Wildlife](./missions/hunting.md) -->

## Industrial

### [Mining](./industrial/mining.md)

### [Salvage](./industrial/salvage.md)

### [Cargo Trading](./industrial/trading.md)

Cargo Trading involves transporting large quantities of goods from one location
to another. This can be lucrative but requires a larger ship, a significant
up-front investment and carries the risk of piracy.
