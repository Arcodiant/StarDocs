# Welcome to Star Docs!

Hi! I'm WhiskoTangey, and I'm a volunteer guide for the game Star Citizen. This
site was created after I found myself answering a lot of the same questions
from new (and sometimes experienced) players again and again, because a lot of
common tasks are not explained directly in the game; especially when those
mechanics can change from one patch to the next.

I'm hoping to build a collection of short, straight-to-the-point guides for
frequent questions about the game's mechanics, so that users don't have to skip
around a video or search through a long-form article to find the specific step
they're missing.

Please check the [Topics](./topics/index.md) to browse the different guides
available, or use the search bar above to find information on a particular
subject. And if you have a question that isn't answered by this site, please
feel free to submit a suggestion on the
[public repo](https://github.com/Arcodiant/StarDocs) - or even submit your own
contributions!

***Note:*** I have no official association with Cloud Imperium Games and
nothing on this site is officially approved by or representative of the views
of that company or their employees. I'm just doing this to try and help other
players enjoy the game!
