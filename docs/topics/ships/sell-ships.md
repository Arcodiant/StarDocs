title: Can I sell ships?
---

{{version_check("3.23.1")}}

Currently, it's not possible to sell ships that are in your hangar, whether you
purchased them via the pledge store or in-game. However, if you find an
abandoned ship in the 'verse (or steal one from an NPC or player), you can
always make money by
[looting and salvaging it](../careers/industrial/salvage/salvage.md).
