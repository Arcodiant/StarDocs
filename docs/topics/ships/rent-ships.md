title: Where can I rent ships in-game?

## Info

While buying ships in-game can take a lot of aUEC, along with the time to earn
it, many ships can be rented at much lower cost. This can give you opportunities
to try new game loops while still starting out, or give ships a test flight to
decide where best to spend your aUEC.

There two main locations from where you can consistently rent vehicles, along
with expos and events that run during the year.

!!! warning "Modifying Rented Ships"
    Note that rented ships cannot be modified in the Vehicle Loadout Manager
    and so you will typically be limited to their stock loadout (though you
    can swap some weapons and components
    [using the tractor beam](./components/swap-components.md#using-a-tractor-beam))

## Renting

=== "At Spaceports"

    Each city spaceport has a dedicated rental location with a range of vehicles
    available, and there are different options available at each one.

    - Simply use the rental terminal, select the ship you want to rent and
    confirm; the ship will appear in your ASOP terminal (or at garage terminals
    for ground vehicles) along with the time remaining on the rental.

=== "Refineries & Cargo Decks"

    The Cargo Decks found at LEO stations, and Refineries at L1/L2 stations,
    have a regular selection of ships available for rental that match with their
    location. That is, Cargo Decks will rent ships that can be used for cargo
    hauling, while Refineries rent out Prospectors for ship mining, and ROCs for
    ground mining, along with Cutlass Blacks to transport the ROCs.

    - Simply use the rental terminal, select the ship you want to rent and
    confirm; the ship will appear in your ASOP terminal (or at garage terminals
    for ground vehicles) along with the time remaining on the rental.

=== "Expos"

    There are annual in-game events, like Invictus Launch Week in May and the
    Interplanetary Aerospace Expo in November, where a large selection of ships
    are put on display at an expo hall somewhere in the Stanton system. Almost
    all ships on display can be rented, at no cost, for 48 hours.

    - To rent a ship at the expo, find the nearby podium for the ship; face the
    podium and hold ++f++ - ithe ship will appear in your ASOP terminal (or at
    garage terminals for ground vehicles) along with the time remaining on the
    rental.
