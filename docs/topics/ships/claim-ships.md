title: How do I get my ship back if it is lost or destroyed?

## Info

During the Star Citizen Alpha, all ships - whether pledged on the RSI store or
purchased in-game - have lifetime, unlimited insurance. This means that no
matter how many times the ship is lost, destroyed or stolen, you can claim a
replacement at no cost. This replacement includes upgraded components and
weapons, but will take some time to make available depending on the size of the
ship.

!!! info
    Other than the wait time for a claim, there is no limit to how many times
    you replace your ship - so don't worry about getting beat up in a dogfight
    or flying into the side of a station while trying to land - there's always
    a fresh new ship waiting for you to try again!

## Claiming a ship

1. Travel to a hangar or spaceport, and find the ASOP terminals.

1. Find the ship in your hangar list; if it is eligible for claiming, the
current status will be displayed along a Claim button.

    > ***Note:*** If you are claiming a replacement for a ship that is stored
    > at your location (to fix a bug or resolve serious damage) you will need to
    > retrieve it and move it away from the hangars at your current location.

    ??? tip "Using Pads"
        The open pads at space stations can be used for this purpose - though
        out of consideration for your fellow players, please don't abandon a
        ship directly on the pad; rather leave the ship open and powered off
        next to the pad and EVA over. This avoids blocking the pad for players
        that need to refuel, and leaves the ship available for towing and
        salvage.

1. Once the claim is registered, you will see a countdown for when the ship will
be available again. This is around a minute for small/starter ships, but can be
longer than an hour for capital ships, so don't claim large ships lightly!

1. Optionally, you can pay an Expedite fee to reduce the time to wait for the
claim - again, this increases based on the size of the ship, but reduces the
longer that you wait. Expediting doesn't always make the claim complete
immediately, but can significantly reduce the wait time.

    > ***Note:*** It's most cost-effective to wait until the "Time after
    Expedite" reduces to Instant - expediting before this point won't make the
    ship available faster, but will cost more.
