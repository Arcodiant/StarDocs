## Info

When you retrieve a ship to a Personal or Public hangar at a space station or
spaceport, the hangar doors remain closed so that you can prepare your ship,
load cargo etc. without interference from other players. Once you are ready to
leave, you will need to signal ATC for launch permission.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
!!! note "If you are on an open pad (such as when retrieving ground vehicles from a Platinum Bay location) you can freely launch from/drive off the pad without contacting ATC."

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
!!! info "You are generally only able to request launch permission for a ship that you own; if you are loaning a ship from another player or party member, it is easiest to have them request launch permission then swap seats."

## Request Launch Permission

1. Sit in the pilot seat of your ship.

1. Contact ATC

    === "Using Keybind"

        - Press the "Request ATC" keybind (`L Alt + N`).

    === "*Alternate*: Using HUD"

        - Locate your Comms MFD. If no MFD is set to Comms,
        [select it from the Menu](./configure-mfds.md).
        - Find the ATC channel for your location - it is usually named after
        the spaceport or station, and is typically near the top of the list.

            > ***Note:*** In some locations, such as the Commons Garage at New
            Babbage, you will see both the location and the spaceport. Use the
            location channel.

        - Click the Open Channel icon on the right-hand side.

    === "*Alternate*: Using MobiGlass"

        - Open your Communications app (`F11`)
        - Click Friends.
        - Find the ATC channel for your location - it is usually named after
        the spaceport or station, and is typically near the top of the list.

            > ***Note:*** In some locations, such as the Commons Garage at New
            Babbage, you will see both the location and the spaceport. Use the
            location channel.
            
        - Click the Open Channel icon on the right-hand side.

1. If there is a queue of players waiting to launch/land, you may see a Queueing
notification with your position in the queue and a max wait time. Note that this
is a *Maximum* wait time, and you should reach the front of the queue much
quicker than this.

1. When it is your turn to launch, you will see a notification reading
"Gateway Granted" and the hangar doors will begin to open.

1. Wait for the hangar doors to open and take off.
