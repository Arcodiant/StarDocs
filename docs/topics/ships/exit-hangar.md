## Info

When you retrieve a ship to a Public hangar at a space station or spaceport,
the hangar doors remain closed so that you can prepare your ship, load cargo
etc. without interference from other players. Once you are ready to leave, you
will need to signal ATC for launch permission.

!!! note "If you are on an open pad (such as when retrieving ground vehicles from a Platinum Bay location) you can freely drive off the pad without contacting ATC."

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
!!! info "You are generally only able to request launch permission for a ship that you own; if you are loaning a ship from another player or party member, it is easiest to have them request launch permission then swap seats."

## Request Launch Permission

1. Sit in the pilot seat of your ship.

2. Contact ATC

    === "Using Keybind"

        - Press the "Request ATC" keybind (`L Alt + N`).

    === "*Alternate*: Using HUD"

        - Locate your Comms MFD. If no MFD is set to Comms,
        [select it from the Menu](./configure-mfds.md).
        - Find the ATC channel for your location - it is usually named after
        the spaceport or station, and is typically near the top of the list.

            > ***Note:*** In some locations, such as the Commons Garage at New
            Babbage, you will see both the location and the spaceport. Use the
            location channel.

        - Click the Open Channel icon on the right-hand side.

    === "*Alternate*: Using MobiGlass"

        - Open your Communications app (`F11`)
        - Click Friends.
        - Find the ATC channel for your location - it is usually named after
        the spaceport or station, and is typically near the top of the list.

            > ***Note:*** In some locations, such as the Commons Garage at New
            Babbage, you will see both the location and the spaceport. Use the
            location channel.
            
        - Click the Open Channel icon on the right-hand side.

3. Wait for the hangar doors to open and take off.
