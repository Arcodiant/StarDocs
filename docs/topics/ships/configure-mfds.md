## Info

Ships & ground vehicles include one or more MFDs (Multi-Function Displays)
attached to their flight seats, which are customisable displays that provide
data readouts and control over various ship systems. While there is a default
configuration for each ship, players can change the screen displayed on each MFD
to access more functionality, or simply customise their flight experience.

## Changing MFDs

1. Make sure the ship is powered up (++ralt+r++ while sitting in the pilot
seat), then sit in any flight seat, crew station or manual turret with MFDs.

    > ***Note:*** If the seat is not the main pilot seat, you may have to power
    it on separately - hold ++f++ and look around the controls for a Power On
    option.

1. When the MFDs are showing, hold F and move the mouse till you are facing the
MFD you want to change.

1. Zoom in on the screen (++"MMB"++).

1. Click the left or right arrows next top the screen name at the bottom of the
MFD.

1. The selected screen is now visible and interactable on the MFD.
