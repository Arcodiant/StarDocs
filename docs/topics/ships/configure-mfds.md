title: How do I change my MFDs?

## Info

Ships & ground vehicles include one or more MFDs (Multi-Function Displays)
attached to their flight seats, which are customisable displays that provide
data readouts and control over various ship systems. While there is a default
configuration for each ship, players can change the screen displayed on each MFD
to access more functionality, or simply customise their flight experience.

## Changing MFDs

1. Make sure the ship is powered up (++ralt+r++ while sitting in the pilot
seat), then sit in any flight seat, crew station or manual turret with MFDs.

    > ***Note:*** If the seat is not the main pilot seat, you may have to power
    it on separately - hold ++f++ and look around the controls for a Power On
    option.

2. When the MFDs are showing, hold F and move the mouse till you are facing the
MFD you want to change.

3. Zoom in on the screen (++"MMB"++).

4. Click the Menu button in the top left of the MFD.

5. Click the screen that you want to display. You may need to scroll
(++"Scroll Wheel"++) to see all available options.

6. The selected screen is now visible and interactable on the MFD.

??? tip "MFD with Multiple Tabs"

    Some screens will have multiple tabs to show more detailed information; for
    example, the Weapons screen includes Guns & Missile tabs with additional
    controls for those weapon types, while Power has a list of all powered items
    (down to the individual thrusters). Simply click the tabs directly under the
    Menu button to switch between them.
