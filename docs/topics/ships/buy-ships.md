title: Where can I buy ships in-game?

{{version_check("3.24.2")}}

## Info

A big part of progressing in Star Citizen is earning up the cash to buy larger
or more specialised ships, or that support multi-crew or new gameplay loops.

With few exceptions, all ships that have been released can be purchased in-game
by earning aUEC and buying them at ship dealers around the Stanton system.
During Alpha, your purchase also includes lifetime insurance and a warranty, so
even if your ship is destroyed you will always be able to replace it and its
components.

??? info "Ship Availability"
    While the majority of ships are available purchase with in-game currency,
    there some exceptions:

    - Recent Releases: Ships are typically made available to buy in-game after
    two major patches or six months have passed since they were added.

    - Limited Releases: Ships like the Sabre Raven and Mustang Omega were only
    available as special offers with hardware deals, like certain Intel SSDs,
    and will never be available to buy in-game.

    - Unlocks: Some ships, like the F8C, will only be available in-game when the
    single-player Squadron 42 game releases, and can be unlocked for purchase as
    a reward for completing that campaign.

??? warning "Game Wipes"
    While Star Citizen is in Alpha and major tech changes are still being
    released, it is sometimes necessary to wipe part or all of the current
    player progression during a patch release. These wipes typically happen
    once or twice a year, and may be limited to specific things (like aUEC
    accounts) or may reset all player progress back to start.

    Note that you will never lose access to items or ships that were pledged for
    with real money - only items acquired in-game can be lost during wipes.

## Buying Ships

There are three locations in the Stanton system that sell ships:

=== "New Deal: Lorville, Hurston"

    The largest of the ship dealers in Stanton, New Deal has a wide selection
    of ships & ground vehicles and is accessible directly from Teasa Spaceport.
    New Deal also has a selection of ships on the showroom floor that you can
    board and tour, including the luxury Constellation Phoenix and the
    Hammerhead gunship.

=== "Astro Armada: Area 18, ArcCorp"

    Astro Armada has less options than New Deal and no showroom floor, but it
    does sell some specialist brands including the different alien ships
    available in-game.

=== "Crusader Showroom: Orison, Crusader"

    Crusader Showroom specialises in Crusader's own ships and is the smallest of
    the ship dealers, but has a large showroom for touring Crusader's larger
    offerings along with terminals for ship weapons and a wide selection of
    missiles and ordnance.

A full listing of ships available at each location and their prices is
available on [Star Citizen Wiki](https://starcitizen.tools/Purchasing_ships).

At each dealer, there are two ways to purchase ships:

### From the Terminal

Each dealer has one or more terminals available, where you can browse the full
selection of ships available by manufacturer.

### From the Show Floor

Each ship located on the show floors is accompanied by a podium with information
about it - you can purchase directly from the podium by facing it and holding
++f++.
