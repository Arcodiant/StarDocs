## Missions

### [Delivery Missions](./missions/delivery.md)

Delivery missions are a simple introduction to missions & contracts in Star
Citizen; they don't pay a lot of money, but they're low risk, and are a great
way to explore different locations around the 'verse.

### [Research Missions](./missions/research.md)

Research Missions are a variant on delivery missions, and involve collecting
survey & scanning equipment and delivering it to orbital locations around the
'verse.
