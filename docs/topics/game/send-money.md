title: How do I send money to other players?
---

## Info

When running industrial missions, trading with other players or hiring them for
rescues and transport, you may want to transfer aUEC directly to other players.
You can do this all directly in your mobiGlass, though there is a 0.5% fee for
transfers.

## Send Money

1. Open your mobiGlass (++f1++) and select the Wallet app.

players in your party, or search for a player name in the top left.

1. Enter an amount; this is the total that the other player will receive. You
will pay this amount, plus the 0.5% fee.
