title: How do I mute Proxy Comms?

{{version_check("3.23.1")}}

## Info

While walking around game spaces like spaceports, cities and stations, you can
talk with other players, even if they are not in your party, by using Proximity
Comms - just hold ++"Numpad \+"++ and talk.

If, however, you want to mute other players, you can disconnect from global
Prox Comms and enjoy your game in (relative) silence.

## Mute Proximity Comms

1. Open the Comms app (++f11++) and select the Global Channel.

1. Click the `Connect to Audio Channel` toggle at the top of the app, or in the
Manage Channel tab.

!!! info
    There are also volume sliders in the Manage tab so you can reduce the volume
    of Proximity Comms instead.
