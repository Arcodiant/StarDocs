## Info

A player's health is tracked as a simple 0-100% stat; at 100% the player is
uninjured, and at 0% the player is incapacitated, cannot act and will slowly
bleed out. As soon as an incapped player is healed above 0%, they will wake up
and can start moving again.

There are many ways to take damage, from combat damage like being shot, to
environment effects like lack of oxygen or extreme temperatures. In some cases,
a player may also take injuries, which must be [treated](./treating-injuries.md)
before you can fully heal; a serious wound may also trigger bleeding, which
will cause the player to lose health continually until they receive healing.

!!! info "Press ++f1++ and select the Health app to get a full run-down of your injuries and any other medical effects."

There are several ways to heal damage to your character, or heal other players.

## Medpens

The quickest way to heal damage and stop bleeding, especially in the field,
is to apply a medpen.

> ***Note:*** There are multiple kinds of medical pen for different situations;
> for healing, you require a red medpen containing Hemozal.

1. Press ++4++ to equip a medpen that is attached to your armour, or drag a
medpen into your hand from inventory.

1. ++"LMB"++ to apply the pen to yourself, or ++"RMB"++ to use it on another
player.

!!! tip
    If you run out of medpens while running an FPS mission, enemies will
    commonly carry medpens that you can loot.

## Medguns

Medguns are a more advanced tool for healing larger amounts of damage, can be
reloaded with additional medigel and have an advanced mode for applying other
medical drugs to [counteract injuries](./treating-injuries.md).

There is also a medical attachment for the Pyro multi-tool that can be used to
heal damage, but does not include the advanced mode of the medgun.

1. Press ++v++ to equip a medgun that is attached to your armour, or drag a
medgun into your hand from inventory. You can also press ++5++ to cycle through
gadgets until your medgun is equipped.

1. Point the medgun at the target, and ++"RMB"++ to see a detailed read-out of
the target's health and injuries. You can press ++b++ to point a medgun at
yourself to get the same read-out and apply healing.

1. Hold ++"LMB"++ to heal damage; as long as the trigger is pressed, the
medgun will continue to heal damage.

## Medbeds

Medbeds are included in medical/rescue vehicles, such as the C8R Pisces Rescue
or Cutlass Red, larger capital/sub-capital ships like the Carrack & 890J, and
are available at the clinics in all stations and hospitals in all cities.

1. If you're at a clinic or hospital, you will have to request a room from the
reception desk terminal. Once assigned a room number, follow signs to find the
room and lie in the bed.

    - In a vehicle, you can go straight to the medical bay and lie in the bed.

    - If you are healing another player that is incapacitated, you will need to
    drag their body to the medbed and select the Place Body prompt on the bed.

1. Immediately on lying in the medbed, any damage will begin healing and your
BDL will start dropping.

!!! info "Blood Drug Level"
    Using medguns & medpens will slightly increase your BDL (Blood Drug Level);
    repeated use of medical drugs will steadily increase this level until your
    character passes out.

    Your BDL will slowly reduce over time; you can speed up that process by
    lying in a medbed or applying a DetoxPen (Resurgera).
