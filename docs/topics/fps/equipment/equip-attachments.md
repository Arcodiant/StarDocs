{{version_check("3.24.3")}}

## Info

FPS weapons and hand tools come with a variety of attachments to improve or
modify their function, such as scopes & suppressors for guns and the functional
attachments for the Pyro multi-tool.

Attachments can be [customised directly](#in-customise-view), via the
[loot HUD](#via-loot-hud), or attached in the [inventory view](#via-inventory).
You must have weapons or tools equipped to your character or carried in their
hands to modify attachments.

## In Customise View

> ***Note:*** In the Customise view, you will only have access to
attachments in your character's personal inventory, e.g. stored in your
core, leg or backpack inventory.

1. Draw the weapon or tool to modify. Note that FPS weapons cannot be drawn in
armistice, so you may need to travel to a hangar or away from cities or
stations to do this.

1. Press ++j++ to open the Customise view. You can also hold ++f++, then
++"RMB"++ on the weapon/tool and select Customise.

    ![Customise View](
        ./images/equip-attachments/customise-view.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Click the slot for the attachment and scroll with the mouse wheel to see
available options. Click the attachment to use and it will equip.

    ![Attachment Slot](
        ./images/equip-attachments/customise-slot.jpg){ width="300" }
    ![Select Attachment](
        ./images/equip-attachments/customise-select.jpg){ width="300" }

1. Press ++j++ or ++"RMB"++ to exit the Customise view.

## Via Loot HUD

> ***Note:*** In the Loot HUD, you will only have access to
attachments in your character's personal inventory, e.g. stored in your
core, leg or backpack inventory.

1. Hold ++i++ to open the Loot HUD.

    ![Loot HUD](
        ./images/equip-attachments/loot-hud.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Tools and weapons with attachment slots are listed on the left; click the
panel with bars to see which slots are available or filled, and which
attachments are equipped.

    ![Loot HUD Slots](
        ./images/equip-attachments/loot-hud-slots.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Hover over an attachment to see where it will be attached by default, and
click if this is the correct slot.

    ![Loot HUD Attachment](
        ./images/equip-attachments/loot-hud-attachment.jpg){ width=600 }

1. You can also drag the attachment to a specific slot.

    ![Loot HUD Drag](
        ./images/equip-attachments/loot-hud-drag.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Click the panel with bars to view the attachment in place, or click it to
remove it from the slot and store it in your personal inventory again.

    ![Loot HUD Attached](
        ./images/equip-attachments/loot-hud-attached.jpg){ width=600 }

## Via Inventory

1. Access a Storage/Gear terminal to access local storage for your location,
open an External Storage location on your ship or press ++i++ to open your 
personal Inventory view.

    ![Inventory](
        ./images/equip-attachments/inventory.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Drag the attachment out of the Inventory window; you will see a blue circle
& dot over compatible weapon/tools slots where you can attach it.

    ![Inventory Drag](
        ./images/equip-attachments/inventory-drag.jpg){ width=600 }

1. Drop the attachment on the slot and it will equip.

    ![Inventory Drop](
        ./images/equip-attachments/inventory-drop.jpg){ width=600 }

    > ***Note:*** You can also double-click an attachment in an inventory panel to
    attach it to the first available, compatible slot.
