## Info

Tractor beams are a highly versatile tool in Star Citizen, used for loading and
unloading cargo, swapping ship components, transporting injured comrades and
even moving vehicles and small ships.

There are two kinds of handheld tractor beam available: a dedicated tractor
rifle that handles larger jobs, and a pistol-sized multitool combined with a
tractor attachment.

> ***Note:*** The MaxLift Tractor Beam rifle is a complete unit, but the
> pistol version is two parts; a Pyro Multitool, plus a TruHold Tractor
> Attachment. Once you have both parts, you must
> [equip the tractor attachment](./equip-attachments.md) to use it.

!!! info
    Handheld tractor beams will have more difficulty moving large crates and
    vehicles than the tractor beams found on vehicles and mechs (like the ATLS).
    Additionally, the multitool tractor beam is unable to lift the larger cargo
    crates (16+ SCU) and you will need a vehicle tractor or the tractor rifle to
    move these.

## Buying

Tractor beams can be purchased in many locations around the Stanton system.
The most reliable is at stores on Cargo and Refinery decks at city, jump point
& L-point stations; there are also city stores like Tammany & Sons in Lorville
and the Covalex store on Providence platform, Orison.

Additionally, multitools and attachments can be bought at large derelict
outposts like Maker's Point, Rappel, Astor's Clearing, Dunboro and others,
plus some equipment stores like Cubby Blast or Providence Surplus.

## Looting

Ground stations around the system like mining & research stations have lootable
crates, containing various gear & consumables. While you can't find the rifle
version of the tractor beam, you can find a variety of limited skins for the
multitools and other attachment. This can be a great way to build up equipment
over time, especially while stocking up on drinks & food.
