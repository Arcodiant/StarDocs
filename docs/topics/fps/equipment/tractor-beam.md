## Info

Tractor beams are a highly versatile tool in Star Citizen, used for loading and
unloading cargo, swapping ship components, transporting injured comrades and
even moving vehicles and small ships.

There are two kinds of tractor beam available: a dedicated tractor rifle that
handles larger jobs, and a pistol-sized multitool combined with a tractor
attachment.

> pistol version is two parts; a Pyro Multitool, plus a TruHold Tractor
> Attachment.
>
> Once you have both parts, equip the multitool (++4++), customize (++j++)
> and select the tractor attachment.

## Buying

Tractor beams can be purchased in many locations around the Stanton system.
The most reliable is at stores on Cargo and Refinery decks at city, jump point
& L-point stations; there are also city stores like Tammany & Sons in Lorville
and the Covalex store on Providence platform, Orison.

Additionally, multitools and attachments can be bought at large derelict
outposts like Maker's Point, Rappel, Astor's Clearing, Dunboro and others,
plus some equipment stores like Cubby Blast or Providence Surplus.

## Looting

Ground stations around the system like mining & research stations have lootable
crates, containing various gear & consumables. While you can't find the rifle
version of the tractor beam, you can find a variety of limited skins for the
multitools and other attachment. This can be a great way to build up equipment
over time, especially while stocking up on drinks & food.
